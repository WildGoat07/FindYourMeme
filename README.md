# FindYourMeme

Best spicy meme finder ever ðŸ‘Œ

Basically, a small window made to search for a meme then copy its image link. That's it.

Base window :

Hovering the mouse over an image displays more infos, and for gifs there is a small indication on the bottom right :

## How it works

It uses the Google API, with a [programmable search engine](https://cse.google.com/cse?cx=2bad711db3c3108e7).
The results are only from [knowyourmeme.com](https://knowyourmeme.com/) for the spiciest, the dankest memes possible.

## Pre building

Before building the project, you have to create a special file, `Key.txt`
at the root of the project with the Google Cloud Plateform API Key, with the right to do a custom search. Then you can restore/build.
